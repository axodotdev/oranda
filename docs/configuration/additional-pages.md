# Additional pages

This option is here if you have more than one markdown file you would like to transform and have on your website.

This option accepts an object where the key is the page name and the value is the path to the markdown file.
Any files passed here will be also added to a navbar at the top of the site.

```json
{
  "additional_pages": {
    "Another page": "./AnotherFile.md"
  }
}
```
