# Introduction

Oranda is a tool for generating beautiful landing pages for your projects.

It can:

- Automagically generate a webpage based off your project readme file
- Include arbitrary Markdown pages
- Generate `mdbook` books for you
- Show downloadable and installable artifacts, and ways to install them, by integrating with [cargo-dist]
- Provide integration with several web analytics providers

and more!

This is the oranda documentation, where we explain how to use the tool in detail. Use the
sidebar to the left to navigate between pages.

> **Caveat emptor!** oranda is still _beta-quality software_! There may be breaking changes at times, especially
  in the configuration format (although we're working hard on stabilizing it)
