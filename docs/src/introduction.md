# Introduction

Oranda is a tool for generating beautiful landing pages for your projects.

It can:

- Automagically generate a webpage based off your project readme file
- Include arbitrary Markdown pages
- Generate `mdbook` books for you
- Integrate with [cargo-dist] to show downloadable and installable artifacts
- Provide integration with several web analytics providers

and more!

This is the oranda documentation, where we explain how to use the tool in detail. Use the
sidebar to the left to navigate between pages.

> **Caveat empor!** oranda is still _alpha-quality software_! Things might change in a breaking way, especially
  the configuration format (although we're working hard on stabilizing it)
