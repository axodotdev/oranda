# Command Line

Oranda currently has three subcommands that work in similar, but nuanced ways.

- [`build`](./cli/build.md)
- [`serve`](./cli/serve.md)
- [`dev`](./cli/dev.md)

Oranda supports some common options on each command:

- `--verbose`. This controls the verbosity level for logs.
- `--output-format`. If you want JSON for processing it with a machine, this is where you'd toggle it.
