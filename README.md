`oranda` is an opinionated static-site generator that is designed for developers
who are publishing projects and would like a website but don't want to build
one from scratch.

<div class="oranda-hide">

`oranda` uses `oranda` so you can checkout a live example [here][`oranda` website]!

## Installation

> oranda build

# start a server to checkout a local version of your built site in a browser
> oranda serve

## Installers: integrating with `cargo-dist`

`oranda` is built to work alongside [`cargo-dist`], which is a tool that builds
distributable artifacts for your Rust applications. To tell `oranda` you are
using `cargo-dist` you can add this to your `oranda.json`:

```json
"artifacts": {
    "cargo-dist": true
}
```

This will link `oranda` and `cargo-dist` such that `oranda` can display your
installers and downloadable artifacts on your page.
