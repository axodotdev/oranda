`oranda` is an opinionated static-site generator that is designed for developers

one from scratch.

## Configuration

If you'd like to configure `oranda`, place an `oranda.json` file in the root of
your project and fill it with the configuration you'd like. Check out the [docs]
to learn more about your configuration options!

## Installers: integrating with `cargo-dist`

`oranda` is built to work alongside [`cargo-dist`], which is a tool that builds
distributable artifacts for your Rust applications. To tell `oranda` you are
using `cargo-dist` you can add this to your `oranda.json`:

```json
"artifacts": {

    "cargo_dist": true
}
```

This will link `oranda` and `cargo-dist` such that `oranda` can display your
installers and downloadable artifacts on your page.
